Graduate Admission Prediction

This project predicts the admission of a student based on different features including university rating, studentâ€™s undergrade GPA,
GRE score, research experience and etc. This predicts that how much chances are there that the student will get admission in his
selected university or not.

In this project I have used multiple algorithms including linear regression, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regressor,
decision tree regressor. In the end I deployed Linear Regression model due to lack of storage on heroku. Otherwise on localhost all models 
are working fine.
